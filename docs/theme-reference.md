# Theme reference

This is everything a theme can change.

A theme is CSS. Most themes only need to redefine the **variables** below. Anything variables can't express, a theme can do by targeting the **classes**.

## Making a theme

1. Open **Appearance** (the palette button at the bottom of the channel list).
2. Pick the theme closest to what you want and press **Copy to edit**. Copying **Classic** gives you every variable below with its default value.
3. Change values in the editor and press **Apply** to see the result behind the editor. **Save** keeps it and closes the editor.
4. To use an image or font, add it under **Images and fonts**, then refer to it by name: `--app-background: url(sky.jpg) center / cover;`. Fonts go in an `@font-face` rule, which works in channel themes too.
5. For phones, add a **Lite version**: CSS loaded on top of the theme when glass effects are Lite. Usually it turns blur off (`--sidebar-backdrop: none;` and the other `*-backdrop` variables) and makes panels more solid.

Your theme is a folder in `data/themes/`, so you can also edit it there with any text editor.

### As a channel theme

Any theme can be a channel's own theme (channel settings → Theme). Then:

- Write the theme as usual, with `:root` and all. Kinaera rewrites it so it only applies inside the channel: `:root`, `html` and `body` become the channel view, and rules for things outside it (like `.sidebar`) simply match nothing.
- Every variable starts from its default, not from the app theme, so the channel looks the same whatever the app theme is.
- The channel shows the theme's `--app-background`, with its `--channel-background` tint behind the messages.
- The app theme doesn't reach into a channel with its own theme, so layout changes it makes (floating panels, shapes) stay outside.

## Variables

All are defined in the `:root` block of `public/style.css`.

### Type

| Variable | What it sets |
| --- | --- |
| `--font-body` | Main font |
| `--font-heading` | Server name, channel title, dialog titles |
| `--font-mono` | Prompt preview |
| `--font-size`, `--line-height` | Base text size and spacing |
| `--font-prose`, `--prose-size`, `--prose-line-height` | Literary posts |
| `--prose-max-width` | How wide a literary post's lines can get |

### Text and accents

| Variable | What it sets |
| --- | --- |
| `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--text-strong` | Normal, secondary, and emphasised text |
| `--em-color` | `*italic*` text, i.e. RP actions |
| `--accent`, `--accent-hover`, `--accent-text` | Main highlight colour, its hover shade, text drawn on it |
| `--danger`, `--danger-text` | Delete buttons |
| `--error-bg`, `--error-text` | Error banner and form errors |
| `--update-bg` | The "Kinaera has been updated" banner |
| `--user-color`, `--friend-color` | Author name colours |
| `--avatar-user-bg`, `--avatar-friend-bg`, `--avatar-text` | Avatar circles |
| `--avatar-saturation`, `--avatar-lightness` | Character avatars. Each character's hue comes from their name (`--avatar-hue`, set by the app); these set the rest of the colour. |
| `--name-saturation`, `--name-lightness` | Character names, in the same hue as their avatar |
| `--scene-break-line`, `--scene-break-text`, `--scene-break-font` | Scene break dividers |

| `--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg` | Rounded corners: small (channel links, badges), medium (inputs, buttons), large (dialogs) |
| `--radius-avatar` | Avatar shape (`50%` is a circle) |

### Backgrounds and panels

Every `*-bg` can be a colour, gradient or image. Every `*-backdrop` is a [`backdrop-filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter), which is how glass effects blur what's behind a panel (for example `blur(16px) saturate(1.4)`). They default to `none`.

| --- | --- |
| `--app-background` | Behind everything: the wallpaper |
| `--sidebar-width` | Sidebar width on large screens |
| `--sidebar-bg`, `--sidebar-border`, `--sidebar-shadow`, `--sidebar-backdrop` | The channel sidebar |
| `--drawer-bg` | The sidebar when it slides over the channel on a phone (defaults to `--sidebar-bg`). Glass themes usually make this more solid. |
| `--sidebar-footer-bg` | The kinwriter card at the bottom of the sidebar |
| `--channel-link-color`, `--channel-link-hover-bg`, `--channel-link-active-bg`, `--channel-link-active-color` | Channel links |
| `--channel-background` | Behind the open channel, on top of the wallpaper |

| `--message-hover-bg` | A message under your finger or mouse |
| `--composer-bg`, `--composer-border`, `--composer-backdrop` | The area around the text box |
| `--dialog-bg`, `--dialog-border`, `--dialog-shadow`, `--dialog-backdrop` | Dialogs |
| `--scrim` | The dark layer behind dialogs and the phone sidebar |
| `--code-bg` | Prompt preview blocks |

| `--button-bg`, `--button-hover-bg`, `--button-text`, `--button-border`, `--button-shadow` | Ordinary buttons |
| `--button-primary-bg`, `--button-primary-hover-bg`, `--button-primary-text` | Send, Save, Create |
| `--icon-button-hover-bg` | Round icon buttons (gear, +, ☰) |

## Sliders (theme options)

A theme can offer sliders in Appearance, each setting a CSS variable its CSS uses. Declare them in the theme's `theme.json`, or in the theme editor under **Sliders**:

```json
"options": [
  { "id": "bubble-transparency", "label": "Bubble transparency", "variable": "--bubble-transparency",
    "min": 0, "max": 0.95, "step": 0.05, "default": 0.55 },
  { "id": "bubble-blur", "label": "Bubble blur", "variable": "--bubble-blur",
    "min": 0, "max": 30, "step": 1, "default": 14, "unit": "px" }
]
```

- `id`: lowercase letters, digits and dashes. `variable`: the CSS variable, starting with `--`.
- `unit` (optional): `px`, `em`, `rem`, `%`, `deg`, `s` or `ms`, added after the number. Without one, the variable is a plain number, which works inside `calc()`: `rgb(0 0 0 / calc(1 - var(--bubble-transparency)))`.
- Give each variable its default in your `:root` block too, so the theme also looks right before the app applies the sliders.
- The app sets the app theme's variables on `<html>`, and a channel theme's on `.channel-view`, where they win over the theme's own values. Up to 12 sliders per theme.

**Rainy Window** is a worked example of sliders and layers (below). The Liquid Glass themes and Rainy Window have sliders for their refraction (see Liquid glass below).

**Backgrounds stay still.** When you scroll, only the messages move: no built-in theme ties its background or layers to scrolling (no parallax), and yours shouldn't either.

## Layers

For backgrounds with depth (a picture, rain, drifting fog), the page has empty elements for themes to draw on:

```html
<div class="theme-layers"><i class="layer-1"></i><i class="layer-2"></i><i class="layer-3"></i><i class="layer-4"></i></div>
```

One set is behind the whole app (a child of `<body>`), and one is in the channel view, for a channel theme. They're hidden until a theme shows them, and the channel view's only appear when the channel has its own theme. A typical start:

```css
body { position: relative; isolation: isolate; overflow: hidden; }
.theme-layers { display: block; position: absolute; inset: 0; z-index: -1; overflow: hidden; }
.theme-layers > * { position: absolute; inset: 0; }
.layer-1 { background: url(far.svg) center / cover; }
```

`isolation` keeps the layers behind the app's content but in front of the page's background. As a channel theme, `body` becomes the channel view, so the same CSS works there. Rainy Window uses all four: the city, rain falling outside, drops on the glass (each showing the city upside down, cut out with a `mask`), and drops sliding down (an animated SVG).

## Free layers for glass effects

Glass themes usually stack several layers on a panel: the blurred backdrop, a glossy highlight across the top, and a soft glow at the edges. The backdrop comes from the `*-backdrop` variables. For the other two, **elements with the `surface` class never use `::before` or `::after` in the base stylesheet**, so a theme can add them freely:

Every surface is already positioned, so these layers can use `position: absolute` without the theme touching layout. Each surface is also its own layer stack (`isolation: isolate`), so `z-index: -1` puts a layer above the panel's background but below its text and buttons:

```css
/* A glossy highlight across the top half of every glass panel. */
.surface::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 0 50% 0;
  background: linear-gradient(rgb(255 255 255 / 0.35), transparent);
  border-radius: inherit;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: -1;
}
```

## Liquid glass (real refraction)

A blur makes glass look frosted, but flat. Real glass is clear, and its thick, rounded edge works like a lens: what's behind bends as it nears the rim, and splits into a faint rainbow there. `public/glass.js` does that for a theme, in Chrome and other Chromium browsers (including on Android). **Liquid Glass**, **Liquid Glass Dark** and **Rainy Window** use it.

Turn it on in your `:root`, then mark which elements are lensed glass:

```css
:root {
  --lensing: on;
  --lens-depth: 26;        /* how far the rim bends what's behind, in px (default 24) */
  --lens-bevel: 20;        /* how wide the curved rim is at least, in px (default 18) */
  --lens-dispersion: 0.4;  /* how much the colours split at the rim, 0 to 1 (default 0.3) */
  --lens-frost: 0.5;       /* a blur behind the glass, in px (default 0: clear) */
  --lens-saturate: 1.35;   /* colour boost through the glass (default 1.2) */
}

.message, .surface, .button, .icon-button { --lens: 1; }
```

- `--lens` doesn't inherit, so only the elements you name are lensed, not everything inside them. glass.js looks at these classes: `.surface`, `.message`, `.button`, `.icon-button`, `.channel-indicator`, `.theme-card`, `.inbox-card`, `.attach-chip`, `.message-comments`, `.posting-as`, `.composer-input`, `.profile-row`, `.notebook-entry`.
- The tuning variables can be set anywhere, so a slider can drive them: `--lens-depth: var(--refraction)`.
- A deeper lens needs a wider rim, so the rim grows with the depth (as far as the element's size allows). The very edge magnifies up to about 3.3 times.
- Keep a normal `backdrop-filter` on the same elements (e.g. `blur(10px) saturate(160%)`): it's what other browsers show, and what Lite mode shows, since Lite turns lensing off.
- Glass inside other glass (a button in the composer) isn't lensed. A panel with a backdrop filter only lets the elements in it see its own fill, not the page behind, so there'd be nothing to bend. It keeps your `backdrop-filter`.
- **A lensed element gets the class `lensed`, and must not reach outside its own box**: no outer `box-shadow` (on it, or on anything inside it) while it's lensed. Chrome versions disagree about where a backdrop filter goes when an element's shadow spills over its edges (some move it by the shadow's size, some don't), so on some phones the lens would miss the right and bottom edges. Keep your floating shadows for other browsers and Lite, and drop them under `.lensed`:

```css
.message { box-shadow: var(--glass-rim), 0 14px 34px -12px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.3); }
.lensed { box-shadow: var(--glass-rim) !important; }
```
- **Don't move your theme layers with `transform`** (not even a static one): Chrome doesn't give a lens the full picture of a transformed layer, and cuts part of it off behind the rims. To animate a layer (like Rainy Window's falling rain), animate its `background-position` instead, or a registered custom property used in it (`@property --fall { syntax: "<length>"; ... }`):

```css
@keyframes fall {
  to { --fall: 400px; }
}
```

- **What it costs.** The lens itself is cheap: a bubble growing as your kinwriter writes only moves the pieces of its map, and nothing is recalculated while you scroll. The browser redraws the glass every frame something behind it moves, though, and two settings multiply that work: rainbow edges (`--lens-dispersion` above 0) take three passes instead of one, and frost (`--lens-frost`) adds a blur. For the smoothest glass, set rainbow edges to 0 and keep frost at 0.5px or less (a hint of blur is free, and smooths the magnified rim).

glass.js also provides two things for liquid themes, in every browser:

- **Goo** (`filter: url(#kinaera-goo)`): shapes that touch merge like drops of water. Both Liquid Glass themes use it on `.typing-dots`.
- **The channel indicator** (`.channel-indicator`, in style.css and js/channels.js): a pill that sits behind the open channel's link and flows to the next one when you switch, stretching over both links (`.stretching`) and then settling with a little overshoot (`.settling`). It's hidden unless a theme gives it `display: block`, a background and a `transition: transform ...`.

## Hooks for theme authors

- `.channel-view` has `data-channel-id`, `data-channel-kind` (`rp` or `ooc`) and `data-channel-theme` (the channel's own theme, or empty). An app theme can use these, e.g. `.channel-view[data-channel-kind="ooc"] { ... }` to style OOC channels differently.
- Every `.surface` is positioned and isolated (see above), so `::before` and `::after` layers can use `position: absolute` and `z-index: -1` safely.
