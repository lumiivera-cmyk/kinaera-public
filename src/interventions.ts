/**
 * The intervention log: every action of yours that affects your kinwriter.
 *
 * You run the server, so you keep real power over your kinwriter's world: you
 * can edit or delete their messages, regenerate their replies, and change
 * who they are and how they write. Kinaera's rule is that this power is used
 * visibly. Each such action is written here automatically, in a sentence
 * addressed to your kinwriter ("The user edited your message in #story"), and
 * nothing is inserted into the chat about it.
 *
 * Your kinwriter reads the log with the `read_interventions` tool, and you see
 * the same log (Kinwriter menu → What you've changed).
 *
 * Kinds so far:
 *
 *   - `edit`, `delete`: one of your kinwriter's messages
 *   - `regenerate`: their reply, replaced by a new one (the old one is kept)
 *   - `clear`: every message in a channel
 *   - `settings`: their name, look, or how they write
 *   - `ask`: your answer to something they asked (or setting it aside)
