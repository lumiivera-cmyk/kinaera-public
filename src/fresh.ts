/**
 * A fresh start: `bun run fresh`.
 *
 * Sets every kinwriter's memory aside and starts Kinaera over. The app then
 * opens on "Meet your new kinwriter": you choose their name, face, who they
 * are and their tastes (or roll them), and their first turn of their own
 * is an orientation. Nothing
 * is deleted: the whole data folder is renamed to `data-old-<date>`, so you
 * can go back by stopping Kinaera and renaming it back.
 *
 * What carries over, because it's yours rather than theirs:
 *   - your connection profiles and roulettes (from your first kinwriter);
 *   - your preferences (models, Jev, reaching out, the heartbeat, quiet
 *     hours, texting, the look), but not anything that's the kinwriter
 *     themselves (name, identity, how they write);
 *   - your own themes;
 *   - your edits to the prompts' wording (Settings → Prompts).
 * Your API key is in `.env`, outside the data folder, so it's untouched.
 *
 * Stop Kinaera first: this refuses to run while it's running.
