/**
 * Turning text into messages.
 *
 * What gets saved for a piece of text depends on the channel:
 *
 * | Channel        | Your post                              | Your kinwriter's reply                      |
 * | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
 * | OOC            | one message                            | one message, voicing no one               |
 * | RP, literary   | one post                               | one post, voicing the characters it names |
 * | RP, casual     | one bubble per character (proxy tags)  | one bubble per `Name:` line               |
 *
 * Messages made from one piece of text are saved together as a *turn* (see
 * `Store.addTurn`), so a casual reply's bubbles can be regenerated as one.
 *
 * Typing `=====` alone (optionally followed by a title) in an RP channel is
 * a scene break instead of a post; see `parseSceneBreak`.
