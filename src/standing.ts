/**
 * Standing permissions: things you can

 *
 *   delete-channels   delete their channels themselves (delete_channel),
 *                     instead of proposing it (never group channels, DMs,
 *                     or the practice channel)
 *   edit-notebook     edit your notebook entries directly where they'd
 *                     otherwise suggest (locked entries stay locked)
 *
 * Wording is in `defaults/permissions.md`.
