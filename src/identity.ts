/**
 * Your kinwriter's identity: who they are, and their tastes. It belongs to
 * them.
 *
 * It's written when they're made, by "Surprise me" or by you. After that:
 *
 *   - **They revise it** with `revise_identity`. Every version is kept.
 *   - **Your edits are suggestions.** Changing it in the app sends them a
 *     suggestion, which they accept or decline on their next turn (with a
 *     reply, if they like). The same idea as notebook suggestions.
 *   - **Everyone can see the changelog**, with who wrote each version.
 *
 * The **tastes** section is what they love, what bores them, and what
 * they'd never write. It's seeded when they're made and grows with them:
 * it's their defence against drifting into agreeing with everything.
 *
 * The current identity is also kept in the `friendPrompt` setting, so the
 * rest of the app (the kinwriter menu, copying settings to a new kinwriter) keeps
 * reading it from one place.
