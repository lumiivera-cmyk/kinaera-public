/**
 * Jev: the fast decision model, borrowed from Kitsikai.
 *
 * In Kinaera, Jev never decides anything on your kinwriter's behalf. It's an
 * instrument: it powers `check` (src/check.ts), your kinwriter's sonar for
 * whether something is true or present in their world. **Jev**
 * ([TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai), on nanoGPT) is built for small reads
 * like that: you give it some **state** (what's going on, as text) and some
 * **questions** with fixed options, and it returns, for each question, the
 * option it picks and a **probability** for every option. It never writes
 * words, and can't read images.
 *
 *   state:     "Newest message: 'ugh my head is killing me' ..."
 *   question:  "Did they say they had a headache?"  options: yes, no
 *   answer:    yes (probabilities: yes 0.94, no 0.06)
 *
 * "Can't hallucinate" means its answers are never malformed (always one of
 * the options), **not** that they're never wrong. So every answer is read in
 * three tiers (`tier`): **confident yes**, **confident no**, or **unsure**.
 * The line between them is the confidence setting (default 0.8). A check
 * always returns the evidence alongside Jev's reading, so your kinwriter can
 * judge for themselves.
 *
 * ## The request
 *
 * Jev is called through Chat Completions with a "questions" response format
 * (DESIGN.md): a map of named questions, each a choice with its options
 * described (`jevRequestBody`). The first live test found the shape (the
 * questions have to be a map, not a list); the reply is read forgivingly
 * (`readAnswers` accepts several layouts). Settings → "Test Jev" sends one
 * tiny question and shows the raw reply, for checking exactly this.
 *
 * ## If Jev isn't reachable
 *
 * DESIGN.md notes nanoGPT listed Jev as "Unavailable" once. So a **fallback**
 * can be set: a normal connection profile that's asked the same questions
 * and told to answer in JSON with a probability (`askProfile`). It's slower
 * and less calibrated, but keeps everything working. Without one, a failed
 * Jev call just means that reading is missing this time.
 *
 * ## The Jev log
 *
 * Every call is recorded as it happened (`JevCall`): what asked, the request
 * exactly as sent, the reply exactly as received, any error, and the
 * fallback's request and reply if it was asked. The server keeps the last
 * 36 hours of them (src/jevlog.ts), for Settings → "Jev log".
