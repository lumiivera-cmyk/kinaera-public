/**
 * The database: where everything is stored, and how its layout is kept up
 * to date.
 *
 * Kinaera uses SQLite, a database that lives in a single file
 * (`data/kinaera.db`) and is built into Bun, so there is nothing to install
 * or run alongside the server.
 *
 * A database stores data in *tables*. Each table has fixed *columns*, and
 * each item is a *row*. Tables point at each other through ids; that is what
 * "data relationships" means. In Kinaera:
 *
 *   channels ──< messages ──< message_characters
 *
 * reads as "a channel has many messages, and a message has many characters
 * it voices". Each message row stores its channel's id (`channel_id`), and
 * each message_characters row stores its message's id (`message_id`).
 *
 * This file only knows about the *layout* of the tables. Reading and
 * writing actual data happens in `src/store.ts`.
 */

import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

/**
 * Every change ever made to the database layout, oldest first.
 *
 * A *migration* is a step that moves the layout from one version to the
 * next. SQLite keeps a version number in the file itself (`user_version`).
 * On startup, any migrations newer than that number run, in order, and the
 * number is updated. So an old database is upgraded automatically, and a new
 * one is built by running every step from the start.
 *
 * Never edit a migration once it has been released: databases that already
 * ran it won't run it again. Add a new one to the end instead.
 *
 * Most steps are SQL. A step can also be a function, for moving data around
 * in ways that are easier to write in TypeScript. A step marked
 * `{ rebuild: ... }` runs with foreign keys off: SQLite can only change a
 * table's CHECK rules by building a new table and swapping it in, and with
 * foreign keys on, dropping the old one would delete everything that
 * points at it.
 *
 * The first step is the whole starting layout; each later step adds to it.
