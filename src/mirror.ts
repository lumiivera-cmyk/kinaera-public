/**
 * The mirror: `read_my_patterns` looks at
 * your kinwriter's own recent messages and reports what recurs. It's plain
 * code, with no model calls, and it's never put in a prompt unasked: they
 * look when they want to, and decide what (if anything) it means. A
 * finding they want to keep goes on their self-page (`keep_pattern_note`).
 *
 * It reports, neutrally:
 *   - openings and closings they reuse (the first and last few words);
 *   - word sequences (4 to 6 words) that recur across different posts;
 *   - how long their sentences and paragraphs run, and how much that varies;
 *   - words they use far more often than the rest of the conversation does.
 *
 * The practice channel is never looked at.
