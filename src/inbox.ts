/**
 * The inbox: what your kinwriter asks of you.
 *
 * Two kinds of thing arrive here:
 *
 *   - **Asks** (the `ask` tool): your kinwriter turning to you, a person, for
 *     something. Each has a kind, so you know what it's about:
 *
 *       context   "remind me who knows the secret"
 *       check     "can you look at this for me"
 *       model     "I'd like a different profile for this scene"
 *       pause     "I need a break from this storyline"
 *       clarify   "I'm not sure what you meant"
 *       prompt    "please keep this memory in full"
 *       other     anything else
 *
 *     You answer in the inbox, or dismiss it. Your answer reaches your
 *     kinwriter on their next turn, whatever the channel, and answering also
 *     gives them a turn of their own, if the hard rules allow
 *     (src/wakeups.ts).
 *
 *   - **Proposals**: things your kinwriter can't do alone, which you approve
 *     or deny. For now that's deleting a channel.
 *
 * Notebook suggestions are shown in the same inbox in the app, but are
 * stored with the notebook (src/notebook.ts), because they belong to their
 * entries.
 *
 * "Delivered" means an outcome (your answer, or how a proposal went) has
 * been in one of your kinwriter's turns. Until then, every turn carries it.
