/**
 * Splitting casual-mode text into bubbles.
 *
 * In casual mode every message is one short bubble voiced by one character,
 * like a group chat (or Tupperbox on Discord). Text arrives as a block,
 * though: your composer box, or your kinwriter's whole reply. This file splits
 * such a block into bubbles, using lines that start with a speaker's name
 * or prefix and a colon:
 *
 *   k: *waves*                ->  Kestrel: "*waves*"
 *   hi!                       ->  (same bubble, next line)
 *   Ilse: Door's open.        ->  Ilse Marrow: "Door's open."
 *
 * The same rules serve both directions:
 *
 *   - **Your posts**: speakers are your characters (Settings → Your
 *     characters), matched by prefix or name.
 *   - **Your kinwriter's replies**: speakers are the characters they play in
 *     the channel, matched by full or first name. The model is asked to use
 *     exactly this `Name: text` format (see `src/prompt.ts`).
 *
 * Only *known* speakers count. A line like `Note: the tide is out` stays as
 * text, unless someone is actually called Note.
