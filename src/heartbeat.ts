/**
 * The heartbeat: a timer that now and then gives your kinwriter a free moment,
 * even with the app closed.
 *
 * Every `heartbeatHours` (each gap varies by ±20%, so it never feels like
 * clockwork), the server checks in on its own. If the hard rules pass
 * (chattiness, quiet hours, the cooldown, at most one double text, not
 * mid-conversation: see src/wakeups.ts), your kinwriter gets a turn of their
 * own ("heartbeat"). What they do with it is up to them: text you, act with
 * their tools, or nothing at all. Most beats stop at the rules, costing
 * nothing.
 *
 * (Whether something is worth saying is left to your kinwriter: no model
 * grades their ideas first.)
 *
 * A message on a heartbeat (or any wake-up) sends a phone notification
 * when the app isn't on screen (src/notify.ts).
