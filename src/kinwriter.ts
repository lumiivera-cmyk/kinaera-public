/**
 * The kinwriter's turn: the single place where your kinwriter writes something.
 *
 * The design doc's core rule is that *a kinwriter turn never requires a user
 * message*. There is one "kinwriter takes a turn" function, and anything can
 * call it:
 *
 *   - you sending a message         (stage 1)
 *   - you pressing "Kinwriter's turn" (stage 1)
 *   - you asking for a regeneration (stage 1)
 *   - you commenting on their post  (stage 6: they reply in the thread)
 *   - an event like opening the app (stage 8)
 *   - a timer, the "heartbeat"      (endgame)
 *
 * The turn itself only ever looks at what's already saved: it reads the
 * channel, builds the prompt stack, asks the model, and saves the reply. It
 * never receives your message as an argument. That's what keeps proactive
 * turns an add-on instead of a rewrite later.
 *
 * ## Tools (stage 6)
 *
 * If the turn's connection profile can use tools, the model is offered them
 * (src/tools.ts), and a turn becomes a small loop:
 *
 *   1. Ask the model. It replies with text, tool calls, or both.
 *   2. If it called tools, run each one (as your kinwriter, with every
 *      permission applied), log it, and send the results back.
 *   3. Repeat, up to `MAX_ROUNDS` times, until it replies without calling
 *      anything. Its text is the post.
 *
 * Tool calls written out in the reply's text instead of the API's field
 * (some models do this) are found and run too (src/toolcalls.ts). Every
 * call, and every mistake, goes into the tool log, which the app shows.
 *
 * Actions take effect as they happen. If a turn is stopped or fails after
 * a tool ran, the action stays done; the log shows it.
