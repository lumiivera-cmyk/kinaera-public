/**
 * Your kinwriter's private journal.
 *
 * **Private.** The journal has no screen in the app: you see only how many
 * entries there are. Its text is never written to any log (the tool log
 * and the check log record that it was used, never what it says), and the
 * prompt preview leaves it out. Your kinwriter's prompt says so honestly,
 * including where the text *does* go: to the model providers that run
 * them, to Jev when `check` searches it, and to a consultant if they
 * attach it to a `consult`.
 *
 * **Forgetting, on purpose.** Each prompt carries the entries your kinwriter
 * chose to keep, then the few newest, within `JOURNAL_BUDGET` characters.
 * Older entries they didn't keep fall out of that as they age. They stay
 * searchable (`read_journal`, `check`), but nothing brings them back
 * unasked. A bad evening fades the way it would for a person, unless they
 * keep it.
 *
 * **Once a week**, a look back: your kinwriter gets a quiet turn with what they
 * wrote that week, to keep, rewrite or let go of entries (src/wakeups.ts,
 * reason "lookback").
