/**
 * Phone notifications, through Termux (borrowed from Kitsikai).
 *
 * When your kinwriter writes on their own (a wake-up or the heartbeat) and
 * the app isn't on screen, you should still find out. The server runs
 * Termux:API's `termux-notification`, titled "Arlo in #ooc" with the message
 * as the text; tapping it opens the app at that channel:
 *
 *   termux-notification --title "Arlo in #ooc" --content "I had an idea…"
 *                       --action "termux-open-url 'http://127.0.0.1:4747/#/channel/…'"
 *
 * The server also takes a **wake lock** (`termux-wake-lock`) when the
 * heartbeat is on, so the phone doesn't put it to sleep (exempt Termux from
 * battery optimization too; see the README).
 *
 * **When**: only when the app isn't on screen. The app tells the server
 * whether it's visible (POST /api/presence) when that changes, and every 15
 * seconds while it is; no word for a minute means it isn't.
 *
 * On a computer (no Termux), there's nothing to run, so notifications are
 * quietly off, and Settings says so.
