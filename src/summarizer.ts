/**
 * The summarizer (stage 7): writes a channel's summaries in the background,
 * with the model, whenever its messages change (see src/summaries.ts for
 * what each summary is).
 *
 * After a channel changes, it waits a few seconds (so a reply and your next
 * message don't each set it off), then catches the channel up, in order:
 *
 *   1. **Finished scenes** without a summary (or whose messages changed):
 *      each is summarized, starting from its "earlier in this scene" notes
 *      when it has them, so a long scene is never read twice.
 *   2. **The story so far**: new scene summaries are folded into it. If
 *      something it covers changed, it's rebuilt from the scene summaries.
 *   3. **Earlier in this scene** (in OOC, the conversation): once more than
 *      `historyLimit + summaryEvery` of the scene's messages are waiting,
 *      the oldest are folded into it, leaving `historyLimit` in full.
 *   4. **The digest**, when the channel has moved on since the last one.
 *
 * Only one catch-up runs per channel at a time, and they never block your
 * kinwriter's turns. If a request fails, the summarizer stops there and tries
 * again the next time the channel changes (or when you press "Update now").
 * Long material is read in chunks, each folded into the notes so far.
