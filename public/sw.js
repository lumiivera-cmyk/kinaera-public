/**
 * Kinaera's service worker.
 *
 * A service worker is a small script the browser runs in the background for
 * a website. Browsers require one (along with manifest.webmanifest) before
 * they offer to install a site as an app on your home screen.
 *
 * Stage 1 keeps it deliberately minimal: it passes every request straight
 * through to the server and caches nothing. The server runs on the same phone,
 * so there's no slow network to hide, and caching would only risk showing you
 * an out-of-date app or chat. If the server isn't running, the browser shows
 * its normal "can't connect" page, which is the honest answer: start the
 * server in Termux.
