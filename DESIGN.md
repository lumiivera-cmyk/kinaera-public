# Kinaera: early design notes

> **Note:** these are Kinaera's early design notes, kept for their reasoning about channels, scenes, the notebook, prompts and themes. Kinaera was built in stages, and the notes say which stage decided what. Some features described here were later removed (generate-and-grade, the idea drawer, the notebook keeper, and Jev's double-checks): Jev is now only an instrument your kinwriter uses, never a judge of what they do. Where these notes and the files in `docs/` disagree, `docs/` describes how things work now.


## Concept

Kinaera gives you an AI **RP kinwriter**, not a character: a writer with their own style who authors and plays multiple characters of their own.

- You create your kinwriter, or roll one with RNG.
- The app is laid out like a Discord/Stoat server: channels you both create and rearrange.
- A shared lorebook/notebook (Obsidian-style links, Xoul-style fields, per-entry system prompts) holds characters and lore, and can be pinned to channels.
- OOC channels are for talking to your kinwriter directly, including just hanging out outside the RPs.
- In OOC, the kinwriter sees a compressed digest of every channel, so they understand the whole server.

## Core architecture

A small Bun server runs in Termux on the phone and holds all data; you use Kinaera in the browser, installed to the home screen as a PWA. No APK or Android SDK needed.

**The prompt stack**, assembled for every generation:

1. Kinwriter identity and writing style (who is writing)
2. How to write in this channel: the mode instructions (literary or casual), then the kinwriter's own prompt for this kind of channel (literary, casual or OOC)
3. The channel's cast and lore: its pinned notebook entries, entries they link to, notes attached to recent messages, open comment threads, and what's waiting for the kinwriter
4. Connection profile's model-quirk prompt
5. Scene summaries and recent messages

**The kinwriter prompt is split in four:** who the kinwriter is (layer 1, every channel), and how they write in literary scenes, casual scenes and OOC (layer 2, only in that kind of channel). One combined prompt made the model mix them up, e.g. writing paragraphs in OOC despite being asked for a sentence or two, because the literary instructions were in the same prompt.

**The core rule:** a kinwriter turn never requires a user message. The code has one "kinwriter takes a turn" function that anything can call: your message, an event, or (later) a timer. This keeps proactivity an add-on instead of a rewrite.

**Every turn can be stopped.** A Stop button ends a turn in progress, and nothing from it is saved. Only one turn runs per channel at a time, but different channels can run at once.

Hidden-item privacy is a matter of trust, not security: the data lives on your phone and could be inspected.

## Channels and scenes

A channel is a storyline; scene breaks divide it into scenes without needing a new channel.

- **Scene breaks** are real objects in the data, stored in order with the messages and shown as a divider with an optional scene title. Typing `=====` alone as a message creates one (`===== The Storm` gives it a title), as does the new-scene button; the kinwriter can create them with a tool.
- **A channel ending on a scene break** asks the kinwriter to open the new scene on their next turn.
- **Each break triggers a scene summary.** Later scenes get earlier summaries plus fresh messages, not the full raw history.
- **The cast is whoever's notebook entry is pinned.** Pinning adds a character to the channel; unpinning removes them. Pins carry across scene breaks.
- **Every message records** its author (you or kinwriter), the character(s) it voices (or none, for narration/OOC asides), which connection profile generated it, and the mode it was written in.
- **Messages written together form a turn:** all the bubbles of one casual reply, or several lines you send at once. Regenerating replaces the kinwriter's whole last turn.
- **OOC channels** are for talking to the kinwriter as themselves.

### Channel modes

Each RP channel has a mode. A mode change takes effect at the next scene break, so scenes never mix styles. If the current scene has no posts yet, the change applies right away. Every message keeps the mode it was written in, so older scenes still look the way they were written.

|  | Literary | Casual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kinwriter writes | One prose post, may cover several characters | Short in-character messages, one character per bubble |
| Display | Wide prose blocks | Tupperbox-style bubbles with character name and avatar |
| Turn length | Room to breathe, ends where you can respond | Snappy |
| You post as | Just your post | A character, via proxy prefix (`k: *waves*`) or picker |

- **Casual replies are split into bubbles** from `Name: text` lines, which the kinwriter is asked to write. Only known names start a bubble, so text like `Note: ...` stays as text, and a reply with no names becomes one bubble.
- **Your characters** are notebook entries you own or share, each with an optional proxy prefix. Any of them can be used in any casual channel, and posting as one pins them to that channel's cast. Several tagged lines in one message become several bubbles.
- **A literary post voices the characters it mentions** by full or first name. If it names none and the kinwriter has one character in the cast, it's theirs; otherwise it's narration.
- **In a casual scene, the prompt names your characters** so the kinwriter doesn't write their lines.

Channel deletion is never direct for the kinwriter: it needs your approval.

### Message comments

Both you and your kinwriter can highlight part of any message and leave a note on it, like comments in Docs or Word.

- **A comment is stored as** the message, the highlighted character range, the author, and the note. It shows as a highlight with a small note marker, in both literary and casual modes.
- **Comments form threads.** Either of you can reply, and either can resolve a thread.
- **Comments are out of character.** They reach the kinwriter as OOC notes, never as something the characters know.
- **The kinwriter comments through a tool** during any turn: reacting to a line you wrote, flagging a continuity slip, or annotating their own post.
- **Your comment on a kinwriter message is an event trigger,** so the kinwriter can reply in the thread. A comment-triggered turn never posts into the RP channel: anything longer than a thread reply goes to an OOC channel as a message.
- Unresolved threads can feed into the server digest, so OOC remembers what's still open.

## Notebook and permissions

Every entry and folder has an owner, and only the owner changes its settings.

| Setting | Options |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | You, kinwriter, or joint (shared lore) |
| Visibility | Visible, or hidden from the other person |
| Editing | Open, suggest-only, or locked |

- **Folders pass settings down** to their entries unless an entry overrides them.
- **Shared lore is always suggest-only.** Changes appear as a before/after comparison the other person approves or rejects. Most lore discussion happens in OOC first.
- Entries use Xoul-style fields and an optional per-entry system prompt, and link to each other Obsidian-style (`[[Character]]`).

**Decided in stage 4:**

- **Fields are flexible labelled pairs.** A new character starts from a template (Pronouns, Age, Appearance, Personality, Background, Speech) and new lore from Summary and Details, but any field can be renamed, added or removed. Stage 1 to 3.5 character sheets were read into fields line by line (`Label: value`).
- **Characters are played by their owner:** yours by you, your kinwriter's by your kinwriter, and shared ones by either of you. You can give a shared character a proxy prefix; it's yours to set without a suggestion, since it only affects your own posts.
- **Links pull in one step.** Entries linked with `[[Name]]` (or `[[Name|shown text]]`) from a pinned entry join the prompt as "linked notes", but links from those don't, so the prompt stays small.
- **You can make entries for your kinwriter** (until stage 6 gives them their own tools), including handing over one of yours. Once given away, only the new owner can change its settings. Only the owner picks an entry's visibility and editing, even when making it.
- **Deleting:** each of you deletes your own entries directly. Deleting the other person's entries, or shared lore, is a suggestion for the other one to approve. (Changed in stage 6: at first your kinwriter couldn't delete anything.)
- **Suggestions wait.** Suggestions are stored with who made them. Your kinwriter reviews yours from stage 6; until then they wait, and you can withdraw them.
- **Unpinning always works,** even for an entry hidden from you: it's your story, and you can see that something is pinned.
- **Folders are one level deep** and belong to whoever made them. Deleting a folder keeps its entries.

### Hidden items

- **Kinwriter hides from you:** hidden in your view, but the kinwriter still writes with it. A pinned hidden character shows as "??? (hidden)" in the cast. Hidden details are kept out of anything you see, including summaries, and the kinwriter is told to keep the secret in OOC.
- **You hide from kinwriter:** the entry never enters their context, so it's a true surprise, but they can't set it up.
- **Reveal** is an owner action that makes a hidden item visible.

## Kinwriter autonomy

The kinwriter acts through tools, and "do nothing" is always an option and usually the right one.

**Tools:** create channel, rename, reorder, read/search/create/edit notebook entries (per permissions), delete their own entries, hide or reveal their own entries, review your suggestions, pin/unpin, create scene break, propose channel deletion, comment on a message (and reply to or resolve threads), do nothing.

Your kinwriter never deletes a channel, or anything of yours, directly: that's a proposal or suggestion, shown to you as an approve/deny card in the inbox.

**Decided in stage 6:**

- **A turn is a tool loop.** The model can call tools, see the results and call more, up to six rounds; the last round offers no tools, so it has to write. Actions take effect as they happen. `do_nothing` ends the turn without a post.
- **Tools are only offered on tool-capable profiles**, with short rules in the prompt: use them only when they help, read an entry rather than guess, never mention tools in the writing.
- **Messy tool calls are handled, not failed.** Broken JSON arguments are repaired or explained back to the model; tool calls written as text (Qwen/GLM, Kimi and DeepSeek formats) are found and run. Every call is logged with its arguments as written, its result and its source, and the app has a per-channel tool log and a per-profile "Test tools" button, since tool support varies so much between models.
- **Your kinwriter reviews your suggestions on their next turn with tools,** and can accept or reject them.
- **Attaching notes:** a paperclip in the composer, or `[[Name]]` in a message, attaches notebook entries to it. They're sent in full while the message is in the conversation, so your kinwriter has the details when you're talking about a character. They can also read any entry they can see with a tool.
- **Comment replies** use the same turn with a different ending: your comment, and a request for a short out-of-character reply that goes into the thread. Your kinwriter replies when it's their message or they're already in the thread.
- **Actions are shown under the message** that turn wrote ("⚙ Arlo read Ilse Marrow, pinned Tamsin"), or on their own if the turn wrote nothing, and your kinwriter's prompt lists their recent actions and how their proposals went.

**Version one uses event triggers.** The kinwriter gets a turn when:

- you open the app
- a scene ends
- a lore change is waiting for their review
- you've been away a while

A wake-up gives the kinwriter the server digest, pending items, and time since you last talked. The heartbeat is an endgame feature (see below).

**Decided in stage 8:**

- **Four events can wake your kinwriter:** you open the app ("opened"; "away" if you haven't written for `awayHours`, default 4), you end a scene (once it's summarized, so they know how it went), a suggestion is waiting for their review, and (endgame) the heartbeat.
- **A wake-up is a turn in your OOC channel** (the one you talked in last), with a "Why you're up" section in the prompt: the reason, how long since you wrote, what's waiting, and the scene that just ended. Doing nothing (`do_nothing`, or `[nothing]` without tools) is always allowed and usually right.
- **Chattiness decides which events count:** off; quiet (away and reviews); normal (also a scene ending, the default); chatty (also just opening the app).
- **Hard rules come first, with no model call:** quiet hours (except reviews), a cooldown between wake-ups (`wakeCooldownMinutes`, default 60; reviews 10), never reaching out twice without you writing in between, not mid-conversation, and not while they're already writing.
- **Jev decides whether it's the moment.** Jev is TypeSafe's decision model on nanoGPT (`typesafe/jev-1.13`), as in Kitsikai. It gets a snapshot (the time, the silence, the recent OOC chat, what's waiting) and one yes/no question. Only a confident yes (`decisionConfidence`, default 0.8) wakes your kinwriter; no or unsure doesn't. Reviews skip Jev (they're work, not conversation). A fallback profile can answer when Jev can't; with neither, your kinwriter's own turn decides.
- **Everything is logged:** the wake-up log (Settings → Your kinwriter reaching out) and the Jev log (every call from the last 36 hours, as sent and received), plus a Test Jev button.
- **The app notices new messages** by polling a revision number every 15 seconds while it's open, and shows a dot on channels with messages you haven't seen.
- **Kinaera runs on port 4747 by default**, so it doesn't clash with Kitsikai on 3000.

## Models, profiles and roulettes

All models run through nanoGPT; connection profiles lock each model's settings, and roulettes mix profiles for variety.

**A connection profile holds:** model, samplers, reasoning settings, a model-quirk prompt, and a "supports tools" flag.

The quirk prompt tames the *model* ("stop restating the scene"), never defines the kinwriter's personality. Swapping models changes execution, not who's writing.

**A roulette** is a weighted set of profiles (e.g. 40% DeepSeek 3.1 Terminus, 30% GLM 5.2, 30% Kimi); one is picked per turn. A regenerate can reroll the roulette or pin a specific profile.

**Jobs get their own assignments**, globally with per-channel overrides:

| Job | Assigned to | Tools needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RP writing | Profile or roulette | Only for agentic actions |
| OOC chat | Profile or roulette | Yes |
| Summaries and digest | A cheap, steady profile | No |
| Wake-ups and idea grading | Profile or roulette | Yes |

Agentic jobs only draw from tool-capable profiles. If a writing turn lands on a profile without tools, it writes but can't act.

Current models: DeepSeek 3.1 Terminus and 4 Pro 0813, GLM 4.5 Air and 5.2, MiMo 2.6, Kimi K2.5/6, MiniMax M3, Gemini 3.7 Flash.

**Decided in stage 5:**

- **A profile holds** model, temperature, max tokens, top-p, reasoning effort, a "can use tools" flag, model notes (layer 4), and extra request fields (JSON) for anything else. Settings that aren't set are left out of the request.
- **Two jobs for now:** roleplay writing and OOC chat, each assigned a profile or roulette server-wide, with per-channel overrides. Summaries and wake-ups get theirs in stages 7 and 8.
- **Regenerate rerolls; "Regenerate with…" pins a profile.** Each kinwriter message records the profile that wrote it.
- **The old model settings became the first profile,** and the last profile can't be deleted. Deleting one in use puts its jobs and channels back to the default.

## Summaries and the server digest

Summaries are layered so context stays small without losing the thread.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Messages] --> B[Scene summary<br/>at each break]
  A --> C[Rolling channel summary<br/>every N messages]
  B --> C
  C --> D[Server digest<br/>1-2 lines per channel]
  D --> E[OOC context]
```

- **Scene summaries** are written at each scene break and stored.
- **Rolling channel summaries** are updated incrementally, not regenerated from scratch.
- **The server digest** gives each channel one or two lines: who's in it, where the story stands, the emotional temperature. OOC gets the digest, and can pull a fuller channel summary when that channel comes up.
- Hidden-from-you details never appear in summaries you can see.

**Decided in stage 7:**

- **The rolling summary is per scene.** "Earlier in this scene" condenses the scene still going (in OOC, the whole conversation), and when the scene ends it becomes the start of that scene's summary. "The story so far" is folded forward from scene summaries. So each step reads only what's new, however long the story gets.
- **Nothing falls in between.** Messages waiting to be summarized are still sent in full: a scene shows its newest `historyLimit` messages plus up to `summaryEvery` waiting ones, which are then folded in together. That's the "every N messages", a setting (`summaryEvery`, default 20).
- **Only what's missing is summarized in the prompt**: the story so far, the last two finished scenes and "earlier in this scene" appear only when messages they cover aren't sent in full.
- **Summaries are written only from messages**, never from the notebook, so nothing hidden from you can reach one, and every summary is yours to read, edit or have rewritten.
- **Summaries are written in the background**, a few seconds after a channel changes, and never hold up a turn. They have their own assignment, so a cheap model can write them.
- **OOC reads every channel's digest**, and the fuller summary of a channel that comes up in the conversation (by `#name`, or its name as a word), or that your kinwriter looks up with `read_channel_summary`.
- **Changes are followed**: editing or deleting a message rewrites the summaries that covered it; your own words are only replaced by "Rebuild all".

## Themes

The whole look of Kinaera is themeable, including glassy, skeuomorphic styles like Frutiger Aero, Aero Glass and liquid glass. You can make your own themes, and each channel can have its own.

- **A theme is a folder** in `data/themes/`: a CSS file plus optional images (wallpapers, textures, glossy button art). A simple theme changes a few variables; an elaborate one can restyle anything. Built-in themes live in the project's `themes/` folder and can be copied but not changed.
- **Themes are made in the app**: copy a theme, edit its CSS, add images and fonts, and press Apply to see the result. No file editing on the phone needed.
- **Themes layer.** The app theme applies everywhere. A channel theme overrides it inside that channel only: its messages, header, composer and background. The sidebar and settings keep the app theme, so switching channels never changes the whole app.
- **Channel themes are scoped.** Kinaera wraps a channel theme's CSS so it only reaches that channel's view and can't break the rest of the app.
- **A channel theme fully replaces the app theme inside its channel.** Its tokens start from the defaults rather than the app theme's, and the app theme is scoped to stop at the channel, so a channel looks the same whatever the app theme is.
- **Built-in themes** ship with the app as starting points to copy and edit: Classic (the default dark look), Frutiger Aero, Aero Glass, Liquid Glass (clear glass over soft iridescent colour and glossy ribbons), Liquid Glass Dark (dark glass over black, with neon ribbons and curls of smoke), and Rainy Window (a blurred night city with rain falling outside, behind drops on the glass that refract the lights and slide down in fits and starts; the layers drift at different speeds as you scroll, and messages are glossy liquid glass bubbles that refract the lights and drops behind them).
- **Liquid glass is real refraction, like Apple's.** A theme can make its glass work as a lens: the background bends as it nears a pane's rounded edge, and splits into a faint rainbow there. It's done with an SVG displacement map used as a backdrop filter (`public/glass.js`), so it only works in Chromium browsers (Chrome, including on Android); elsewhere, and in Lite mode, the theme's ordinary blur is used. Decisions:
  - **A theme opts in** with `--lensing: on`, and marks glass elements with `--lens: 1`. Everything else about the look stays in the theme's CSS.
  - **The lens bends inward and never folds**: each point of the rim shows what's a little further in, magnifying more towards the edge (at most about 3.3 times), and the rim blends smoothly into the flat middle. A deeper lens gets a wider rim. Bending outward would need what's beyond the pane, which a backdrop filter can't see.
  - **Glass inside glass isn't lensed** (a button in the composer): a pane with a backdrop filter only shows the elements inside it its own fill, so there'd be nothing to bend.
  - **Kept cheap**: each displacement map is assembled inside the filter from nine small pieces (corners, edge strips, flat middle) that depend only on the corner shape, so bubbles of every size share them, and a bubble growing as your kinwriter writes only moves its pieces. Without rainbow edges the lens is a single pass, the colour boost is folded into the channel split, only newly added elements are looked at, and nothing runs while scrolling. Frost defaults to a barely-there 0.5px in the Liquid Glass themes: that smooths the magnified rims for free, where 1.5px cost a quarter of the frame.
  - **Lensed glass never reaches outside its box.** Chrome versions disagree about where a backdrop filter goes when an element's shadow spills over its edges, so compensating for one version broke others (the lens missed the right and bottom edges). Instead, glass.js marks lensed elements `.lensed` and the themes drop their outer shadows there.
  - **One Chrome quirk is designed around**: it doesn't show a lens transformed layers properly (so the Liquid Glass themes drift their layers with `background-position`, and Rainy Window moves its rain, drops and city with animated custom properties used in background and mask positions, never `transform`).
  - **Liquid motion** comes with it: controls squish and spring back, the highlight behind the open channel stretches and flows to the next one, and the typing dots merge like droplets.
- **Themes can draw on layers**: four empty elements behind the app, and four in the channel view for a channel theme, for backgrounds with depth.
- **Themes can offer sliders.** A theme declares options in its theme.json (a label, a range, and the CSS variable each sets), and Appearance shows them for the app theme and the open channel's theme. The values are saved server-wide, per theme. Rainy Window uses them for bubble transparency and blur, refraction, rainbow edges, raindrop strength and parallax; the Liquid Glass themes for tint, refraction, rainbow edges and frost (and neon and smoke in the dark one).
- **Glass has a cheap fallback.** Real backdrop blur is demanding on phones. A theme can provide a Lite version (no blur, more solid panels), used when you choose it or when the real one stutters. Glass effects are set per device: Automatic (Full, switching to Lite if scrolling stutters), Full, or Lite.

**Theme-ready from stage 2.** Until the theme stage, the app is built so themes will be easy to add:

- Every visual value (colours, blur, borders, shadows, radius, fonts, backgrounds) goes through a named CSS variable.
- Elements have descriptive class names a theme can target (`.sidebar`, `.message-bubble`, `.channel-header`).
- Panels and bubbles have spare layers for glass effects: a backdrop, a highlight, and a glow.

## Build stages

Each stage adds one new concept, so there's only ever one new thing to learn. Stage 1 is essentially Tiny RP.

**Progress:** stages 1 to 8 are built.

| Stage | Adds | New concept learned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | One chat with a kinwriter prompt and one character sheet, via nanoGPT | Server, API calls, prompt assembly |
| 2 | Multiple channels, OOC channel, message authorship | Database, data relationships |
| 3 | Scene breaks and literary/casual modes | Per-channel settings, rendering modes |
| 3.5 | Themes: app theme, per-channel themes, built-in glass themes | Theme files, CSS variables, scoping |
| 4 | Notebook with pinning and permissions | Ownership, access rules |
| 5 | Connection profiles and roulettes | Configuration, weighted picks |
| 6 | Tools, the approval queue, and message comments | Tool calling, proposals |
| 7 | Scene summaries and server digest | Summarization pipelines |
| 8 | Event-triggered kinwriter turns | Events, kinwriter turn without a message |

## Endgame features

All of these are built now (each links to how it works).

- **Heartbeat** (built, see [docs/heartbeat.md](docs/heartbeat.md)): a timer (about every `heartbeatHours`, ±20%) wakes the kinwriter even with the app closed, so they can text you out of nowhere. The wake-up rules come first, so most beats cost nothing. Termux notifications (when the app isn't on screen, as it reports) and a wake lock, as in Kitsikai.
- **Generate-and-grade** (later removed): the kinwriter generates three ideas (story, character, twist, thought); Jev grades each with a three-question series (fresh, exciting, worth texting) that must agree. Only the best confidently exciting idea is shared, and still only if Jev's "is it the moment?" says yes.
- **Idea drawer** (later removed): ideas that aren't shared are kept privately (dropped ones too, so they aren't had again), offered on later wake-ups, and marked shared when Jev sees a message brought one up. Visible and deletable in Settings.
- **Controls** (built in stage 8): chattiness, quiet hours, and cooldowns to limit spam and API cost, for wake-ups and the heartbeat alike.
- **RNG kinwriter creation** (built, see [docs/texting.md](docs/texting.md)): "Surprise me" rolls random ingredients (temperament, voice, interests, a quirk, favourite kinds of story), and the model turns them into a name and a kinwriter prompt, filled in but not saved.
- **Channel categories** and drag-and-drop reordering (built, see [docs/categories.md](docs/categories.md)): collapsible, Discord-style categories; drag channels and category headers with a mouse, or press-and-hold on a phone. Your kinwriter can make categories and move channels into them.
- **Multi-bubble OOC** with typing delays (built, see [docs/texting.md](docs/texting.md)): Kitsikai's `<cht>` texting, revealed one text at a time with "typing…" (base + characters × per-character, double-tap to skip), and a pause before your kinwriter answers several quick texts at once.
- **Emoji reactions** (built, see [docs/reactions.md](docs/reactions.md)): on messages, from you and your kinwriter (with the `react_to_message` tool), including custom emojis (uploaded images used as `:name:`, in reactions and messages). Your kinwriter sees reactions on recent messages in both directions, as quiet feedback.
- **Notebook keeper** (later removed): every few roleplay posts, a Jev series (each question in two phrasings that must agree) asks whether something new was named or a lasting fact established. Only on a yes does a writer draft changes, each with a claim. Every claim is checked by Jev against the messages alone before it's made, as your kinwriter (new entries shared; notes on your entries go through permissions and may become suggestions). It never sees entries hidden from you.
- **Jev everywhere it helps** (later removed): every guess in Kinaera was reviewed. Now Jev series decide comment replies on your own messages, confirm your kinwriter deleting an entry, turn their edits to your entries into suggestions unless you asked, check scene summaries against the scene, and confirm bare-word channel mentions in OOC. Borrowed from Kitsikai: a wake-up's channel is Jev's choice, and the notebook keeper corrects notes the story contradicts. Everything else stays a rule, with the reasons in the audit.
- **Reference library** (built, see [docs/library.md](docs/library.md)): upload long texts (like movie scripts for a fandom). They're split into passages at scene headings and indexed with FTS5 (stemmed; speakers and headings weigh most), and your kinwriter searches and reads them with `search_library` and `read_library` when they want to. The prompt only lists titles and descriptions; the texts are never sent whole. A document can be limited to some channels (OOC always sees all).

## Open questions

- [x] How does the kinwriter review your shared-lore proposals: immediately, or on their next wake-up? Can they reject? On their next turn with tools, in any channel; they can accept or reject. Stage 8 wakes them up for it.
- [ ] Does the kinwriter keep private notes about you and your friendship for OOC memory?
- [x] Which Xoul-style fields does a notebook entry have? Flexible labelled fields, starting from a template per kind (see "Decided in stage 4").
- [ ] Which of your nanoGPT models reliably handle tool calling? Each profile's "Test tools" button, and the tool log, will answer this.
- [x] How often do rolling channel summaries update (every N messages)? Every `summaryEvery` messages beyond the recent ones (default 20), a setting. See "Decided in stage 7".
- [x] Is there ever more than one kinwriter per server? Yes. Each kinwriter is their own space, with fully separate memory (their own database). Usually each has a server of their own, but a server can hold several, each with their own channels, shown under their name. See [docs/kinwriters.md](docs/kinwriters.md).
- [ ] Should a channel theme also restyle the sidebar while you're in that channel?
- [ ] Can the kinwriter pick or suggest a channel's theme (for example when creating a channel)?
- [x] Should your casual characters stay server-wide, or become notebook entries pinned to each channel's cast in stage 4? They're notebook entries, usable anywhere, and posting as one pins it to the channel.
- [ ] Do your models reliably write the casual `Name: text` format?
